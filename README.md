# CSC-135

These projects are part of the CSC-135 class at California State University, Sacramento

# Overview

The purpose of these projects is to apply hands-on knowledge about logic and functional programming languages such as Prolog, Scheme. The first project is a Recursive Descent Recognizer written in Java, it can take an input string and validate based on a default grammar. The second project is written in Scheme while the third one in Prolog. While these projects are very small, they helped me to understand how a parser work in compiler and how functional programming works.

# Dependencies

The second project need to run in Racket-Scheme, and the third project in Swi-Prolog.
